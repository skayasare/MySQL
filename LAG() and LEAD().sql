Exercise #1:
Write a query that can extract the following information from the "employees" database:
- the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts signed by all employees numbered
between 10500 and 10600 inclusive.
- a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list
- a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list
- a column displaying the difference between the current salary of a certain employee 
and their previous salary
- a column displaying the difference between the next salary of a certain employee 
and their current salary
Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.
Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number.

Exercise #2:
The MySQL LAG() and LEAD() value window functions can have a second argument,
designating how many rows/steps back (for LAG()) or forth (for LEAD()) we'd like to 
refer to with respect to a given record.
With that in mind, create a query whose result set contains data arranged by the 
salary values associated to each employee number (in ascending order).
Let the output contain the following six columns:
- the employee number
- the salary value of an employee's contract (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as 
the employee's current salary)
- the employee's previous salary
- the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary
- the employee's next salary
- the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary
Restrict the output to the first 1000 records you can obtain.
